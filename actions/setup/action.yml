  disableCache:
    description: Disable cache
    required: false
    default: false

  go-version:
    description: The Go version to download (if necessary) and use. Supports semver spec and ranges.
    required: false
    default: '1.22'

  cacheKey:
    description: Custom cache key used
    required: false
    # NOTE: some projects cannot use **/go.sum because: https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/449
    # In such cases, try providing the cache key and set it to e.g. ${{ hashFiles('go.sum', '*/go.sum') }} instead
    default: ${{ hashFiles('**/go.sum') }}

  check-latest:
    description: If true, checks whether the cached go version is the latest, if not then downloads the latest. Useful when you need to use the latest version.
    required: false
    default: false

  fetch-depth:
    description: Number of commits to fetch. 0 indicates all history for all branches and tags.
    default: 0

    # NOTE: cache key and restore key is not the same;
    # We want to always re-use the cache created by master in all our PRs. We also want any PR which modifies go.sum to create a new cache for itself.
    # Therefore the cache key is set to use GITHUB_REF_NAME and the restore key is set to use GITHUB_BASE_REF.
    # For more details, see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#default-environment-variables
    # NOTE: you need to build on push to master and on pull request in the repos which uses this reusable workflow.
